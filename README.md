**What is a TRANSISTOR**

  * Transistor is a semiconductor device which is used in electronic circuits to amplify or switch signals.
  * It is mainly used to CONTROL THE CUREENT FLOW.

  App: 
  * Amplification: Increasing the strength of an electrical signal.
  * Switching: Controlling the flow of current on and off.

* Diode: A diode is formed when a silicon is doped with N type (Phosphrous) and P type (Boron)
* Phosphorous has 5 valence electron **(N)** and boron has 3 valence electron **(P)**, electrons from N travel to P forming depletion region.
* In FORWARD BIAS more electrons get diffused in N type, and as there are holes in p type electrons are drifted towards P type, casuing current to flow.

__BJT Transistor__(Both e and p contribue in flow of current):

* Emitter (heavily doped), base, Collector.
*  one side is forward biased, another is reverse biased.
*  small amount of base current is amplified at collector current.
*  To make transistor work as **amplifier** CONTROL THE CURRENT IN TRANSISTOR
*  To make transistor work as **switch** CONTROL THE THRESHOLD VOLATGE 


__Modes of Operation__

* Active region: Current flows from E to C - Vc>Vb>Ve
   * emitter-base is FB
   * collector base is RB
     
* Cutoff region: No current flows - Ve>Vb
  * emitter-base is RB
  * collector base is RB
    
* saturation region: Vb>Ve & Vb>Vc
  * emitter-base is FB
  * collector base is FB
 
__FET Transistor:__

semiconductor devices that control the flow of current between a source and a drain terminal using an Voltage.
 
*Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs):*

* The gate terminal is a PN junction.
* The gate voltage controls the width of the channel between the source and drain.

*Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs):*

* The gate terminal is insulated from the channel by a layer of oxide.
* The gate voltage controls the formation of a channel between the source and drain.
